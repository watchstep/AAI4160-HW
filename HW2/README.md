## Setup

See [installation.md](installation.md). It's worth going through this again since some dependencies have changed after homework 1. You also need to make sure to run `pip install -e .` in the hw2 folder.

## Complete the code

There are TODOs in these files:

- `aai4160/scripts/run_hw2.py`
- `aai4160/agents/pg_agent.py`
- `aai4160/networks/policies.py`
- `aai4160/networks/critics.py`
- `aai4160/infrastructure/utils.py`
